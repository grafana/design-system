We have several tools available to help designers and developers build better solutions with our Saga Design System.

## Internal Designer Resources

Use these Figma libraries to design and mockup Grafana experiences.

_These are **internal only** resources for now._

<div className='two-column-div' style={{ display: "flex" }}>

</div>

## Community Designer Resources

The Saga team is happy to provide Figma community assets of both our dark and light theme component libraries. We hope these resources are helpful in your design needs.
