Alerts display important messages in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting their task.

## Behaviors

| Type           | Purpose                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persistent** | <p>They are usually urgent and intrusive, require immediate attention and require action to be dismissed.</p> |
| **Passive**    | <p>Are informational, report a system issue that does not require any action by users.</p>                    |

## Types

Within Grafana, we have three different types of alerts and they can be used depending on the context and content.

| Type       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Behavior                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Inline** | <p>To notify users of the status of an action. They appear at the top or bottom of the main content area</p>                                                                                                   | <p> Passive or Persistent </p> |
| **Toast**  | <p>These temporary window elements are used to display short messages; they appear at the top-right corner of the screen and can be dismissed by clicking the [x] or it will disappear after a few seconds</p> | <p>Passive</p>                 |
| **Banner** | <p>It will remain until the user rejects it or until the status that triggered the banner is resolved</p>                                                                                                      | <p> Persistent </p>            |
