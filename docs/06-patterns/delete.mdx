# Delete <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>

Deleting within Grafana is a multi-tiered pattern that varies based on the required amount of friction (see: [Design Principle: Tasteful Friction](/foundations/design-principles#tasteful-friction)) and importance of the item being deleted.

# Tiers

Check definitions and use cases to choose the right pattern.

### **Inline delete**

The quick and easy way to delete non-risky content that's easy for the user to re-add. Typically used with IconButton with the **trash-alt, times-circle, **or **times **icon, with no confirmation step. Used for removing things such as rows or line items.

### **Type to delete (delete dialogue)**

The most friction: when accidental deletion might be disastrous. This pattern demands the entire focus of the user to make sure they're fully aware they are destroying something (and what), and confirm it explicitly with more than just a button click. Useful when changes will have ripple effects.\*\* \*\*

# Implementation

Depending on the tier of delete pattern, there are varying ways they get implemented. Below outlines how each tier should be implemented for user success and product consistency
