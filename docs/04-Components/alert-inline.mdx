Inline Banners are task-oriented alerts that notify users of the status of an action or system. These alerts are contextual — appearing above or below main content areas — allowing users to address issues or to read messages quickly. See examples below:


![Image description](/img/inline_example.png 'Visual representation of inline notification')

1. Landing page with their content area
2. Inline Notification related to that content


### Do’s


* Use the appropriate status for the message (info/success/warning/error).
* Use plain, simple language for the messages to ensure users understand them and know how to address them.
* Focus on notifications if they are relevant to the users' current workflow and should be addressed immediately.


### Don’ts


* Do not use Primary calls to actions.
* Do not hide other content with inline notifications.
* Do not repeat the alert copy/title on the details message.



## When to use

* Inform at that time how to continue a task in which users must perform an action.
* To provide some options for users to take action.
* To explain in detail the reasons why something can’t be done by users.

![Do](/img/do_inline1.png) Use the default button as an action.



![Dont](/img/dont_inline1.png) Do not use more than one call to action per notification.



![Do](/img/do_inline2.png) Be concise and clear, with a body content less than two lines, to provide users with detailed information on next steps.



![Dont](/img/dont_inline2.png) Do not use a button and the close icon together.
