## Overview

The Box Component is the most basic layout component. It can be used to build more complex components and layouts with properties that use our design tokens.

### When to Use

Box should be used instead of class styles, so that we can take advantage of our design tokens.
Use it for anything from adding margin around a component to giving a border to a section.

## Usage

[//]: # "Lists different options/props for the component, each with a code sample, and more specific usage guidelines. Includes Dos & Don'ts"

## Playground

<ComponentEmbed path="/story/general-layout-box--basic" />
