`IconButton`s are actionable buttons that show only an icon. Since there is no regular label it’s critical to include a tooltip with all IconButtons so the label can be accessible on hover.

### Do’s

* Always include the button label in a tooltip
* When using `IconButton` together with text make sure to align them by adding a wrapper with `display: flex`and `align-items: center`
* Use in areas that are limited in space and are low-context
* Ensure the meaning of the icon is well understood and unambiguous
* Use `IconButton` instead of Button with only an icon
* In exceptional cases where the tooltip does not make sense and the icon is unambiguous (e.g <Icon name="angle-down" /> for expanding a folder): add aria-label and the tooltip will be removed.

### Don’ts

* Do not use in hight-context situations


## Variants

| Type | Style | Purpose |
| ---- | --- | ------- |
| **Primary** | Ghost | Used for primary-based actions, only use one per section. If there is no primary action, all Button components should be secondary. |
| **Secondary** | Ghost | Default-styling of buttons, this style is used the most within Grafana and can trigger various actions. |
| **Destructive** | Ghost | Used for delete actions |
| **Disabled** | Ghost | If the functionality the IconButton provides is not available but the IconButton is supposed to show that there is this kind of functionality.|

## Formatting

### Anatomy

* Icon
* Container (on hover)


### Placement

`IconButton`s are best used in areas that are limited in space and are action-heavy. These could be toolbars or in areas that provide inline editing such as tables or cards.

* Add a text for tooltip (it will also be used as the aria-label)
* In exceptional cases where the tooltip does not make sense add the aria-label.
