# Toggletip <Badge text='ready' color='green'></Badge>

Toggletips, similar to [Tooltips](/Components/tooltip), provide contextual support for users when needed. They are hidden by default, a UI trigger or text link is clicked to set them to their visible state. Toggletips, unlike tooltips, are persistent until a user takes action to dismiss them by clicking on the required ‚ÄúX‚Äù (close) trigger.

## When to use

Toggletips reveal **supplemental content** when a user clicks a button or another UI element and remains actively open until a user dismisses it.

### Do's

- Use when further context is needed to understand a topic
- Link to supporting documentation or content via link
- Use when an interactive element must be placed within a tooltip-like component
- Use content that needs to persist for users to reference and until they dismisses it
- Use for content that is informational to what a user is actively working
- Provide users ways to navigate to docs for further learning

### Don'ts

- Do not use if a user would be configuring, selecting, entering data, or editing content on a page through the toggletip
- Do not use when a [tooltip](/Components/tooltip) with clarifying text would suffice
- Do not house information critical to user‚Äôs task completion
- Do not hide required information from a user to complete a task or workflow
- Do not use to surface actions to users

## Accessibility

Toggletips are revealed by click rather than by hover and focus. It‚Äôs important that they make screen readers announce the information after the click event.

- Include [ARIA live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)
- Use **type=‚Äùbutton‚Äù **to avoid mistaking the trigger as a submit button
- Use a describable label or aria-label on the UI-Trigger to make sure the user understands what extra information is in the Toggletip content (i.e. ‚ÄúMore information‚Äù)

## Content

Toggletips may contain a variety of information, from descriptive text to interactive elements such as buttons or links.

## Behaviors

### Triggers

- Toggletips display on
  - **user** **click** of UI trigger
  - pressing** ENTER **or **SPACE **on a keyboard while the trigger element has focus
- Toggletips dismiss by:
  - **user click **of close icon (x) ‚Äî optional
  - clicking outside of the popover container
  - pressing the **ESC** key

### User Interactions

- Toggletips are intended to house interactive elements within them. UI elements such as buttons, text links, dropdowns, etc. are able to be fully interacted with inside of the toggletip.

### Scrolling

- In the instance that a toggletip requires scrolling of content (e.g. with a dropdown) the header and the footer of the toggletip remains fixed with the body enabling scroll

### States

Toggletips have two states.

- Hidden¬†‚Äî the default state of toggletip
- Visible ‚Äî state change triggered by ui-trigger click or keyboard enter
