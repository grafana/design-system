## When to use
The Field component is suitable for various scenarios where you need to incorporate form inputs into your React application. Some common use cases include:
- Creating forms with labeled input elements.
- Adding descriptions to help users understand the purpose of the input.
- Applying validation and error messages to form fields.
- Indicating loading or disabled states for input fields.

## Implementation / Options

### Validation
Use the `invalid` prop to indicate that the input is invalid. This will add a red border to the input and display the error message provided in the `error` prop. For this to work, both the `invalid` and `error` props must be set.

### Loading
Use the `loading` prop to indicate that the input is loading. This will add a spinner to the input.
