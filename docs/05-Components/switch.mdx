The `Switch` component is used to toggle between two states, typically representing an on/off or enabled/disabled state.

## When to Use

Use the `Switch` component when you need to provide users with the ability to toggle between two states, such as enabling or disabling a feature, setting preferences, or making binary choices.

Switches trigger changes immediately. If your component should trigger a change only after sending a form, it's better to use either `RadioButtonGroup` or `Checkbox` instead.

Furthermore, switches cannot be grouped â€“ each `Switch` triggers an independent state update. If you want multiple mutually exclusive choices, the `RadioButtonGroup` is the better option. To offer multiple choices within the same group or context which are not mutually exclusive, use `Checkbox` instead.


## Implementation / Options

### Props

The `Switch` component accepts the following props:

- `value` (boolean, optional): Sets the initial value of the switch. When true, the switch is in the "on" state; when false, it is in the "off" state.
- `transparent` (boolean, optional): Makes the switch's background and border transparent for inline use.
- `invalid` (boolean, optional): Shows an invalid state around the input, typically for indicating errors.

#### Example Usage

```jsx
import { Switch } from '@grafana/ui';

<Switch
  value={true}
  transparent={false}
  invalid={false}
  onChange={(event) => handleSwitchChange(event)}
  label="Toggle feature"
  disabled={false}
/>
```
