# Inline Banner <Badge text='ready' color='green'></Badge> <a href='https://developers.grafana.com/ui/latest/index.html?path=/story/overlays-alert--examples' target='_blank' className='header-links'>Storybook <Icon name="external-link-alt"/> </a>

Inline Banners are task-oriented alerts that notify users of the status of an action or system. These alerts are contextual — appearing above or below main content areas — allowing users to address issues or to read messages quickly.

### Do’s

- Use the appropriate status for the message (info/success/warning/error).
- Use plain, simple language for the messages to ensure users understand them and know how to address them.
- Focus on notifications if they are relevant to the users' current workflow and should be addressed immediately.

### Don’ts

- Do not use Primary calls to actions.
- Do not hide other content with inline notifications.
- Do not repeat the alert copy/title on the details message.

## When to use

- Inform at that time how to continue a task in which users must perform an action.
- To provide some options for users to take action.
- To explain in detail the reasons why something can’t be done by users.
