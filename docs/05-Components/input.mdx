A basic component that allows a user to write or edit text.

## When to use
Use inputs in forms to help people enter, select, and search for text. Inputs are normally found within a form but can also be part of a modal, search, or card.

### Form usage
Inputs should be used with the **Field** component to provide labels and descriptions for the input. 

## Implementation / Options
### Icon placement
The input is able to have icons placed at the beginning or at the end of the input. This allows for the creation of inputs like search fields with a magnifying glass icon.

### Placeholder text
The input has ability to have placeholder text. Use placeholder text sparingly, as placeholder text is often confused for actual text. Confusing placeholder text for text often results in higher error rates with users missing inputs that need filled out. When the input is used with field,  placeholder text should not be used in favov of using the label and description.

### Prefix / Suffix 
An element, such as an Icon to show inside the input at the beginning or the end of the input

### addonBefore / addonAfter
An accessory, commonly a button, that can occur before or after the input. 


## Types and Behaviors
### Text
A text input allows users to enter text, numbers, and special characters into the input.

### Number
A number input limits users to only entering numerical characters into the input.

### Password
A password input masks the characters entered by the user.

### States
#### Invalid
The invalid state for the input signifies that the provided content needs correction or additional content needs to be added before the user is able to proceed.

#### Loading
For some situations, the input is able to indicate that it is loading.

#### Disabled
Depending on user permissions or if an input is synced with a datasource, an input can have a disabled state.
