# Toggletip <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>

Toggletips, similar to [Tooltips](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ec8debAzPXO4nkUz9qNy2BeLgwvoNsvPRsOUSkmH8SE/edit?usp=sharing), provide contextual support for users when needed. They are hidden by default, a UI trigger or text link are clicked to set them to their visible state. Toggletips, unlike tooltips, are persistent until a user takes action to dismiss them by clicking on the required ‚ÄúX‚Äù (close) trigger. Toggletips are capable of containing varying types of complex content including interactive components, buttons, and dropdowns.


### When to use



* Users need further context to understand or learn a topic
* Links to supporting documentation or content are needed to provide
* When an interactive element must be placed within the popover
* When content needs to persists for consumption until the user dismisses it


### When not to use



* When only a primary label or an auxiliary clarification is needed to be displayed (see: [Tooltip](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ec8debAzPXO4nkUz9qNy2BeLgwvoNsvPRsOUSkmH8SE/edit?usp=sharing))
* Do not house information critical to user‚Äôs task completion
* Do not request required information from a user to complete a task or workflow

## Accessibility

Toggletips are revealed by click rather than by hover and focus. It‚Äôs important that they make screen readers announce the information after the click event.



* Include [ARIA live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)
* Use **type=‚Äùbutton‚Äù **to avoid mistaking the trigger as a submit button
* Use a describable label or aria-label on the UI-Trigger to make sure the user understands what extra information is in the Toggletip content (i.e. ‚ÄúMore information‚Äù)
