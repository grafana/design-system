# Tooltip <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>

Tooltips display additional information upon hover or focus. The information included should be contextual, helpful, and non-critical to the user‚Äôs task-at-hand. The information should be concise and provide clarity to the user.

## Usage

<b>Do's</b>

* Provide supportive, explanatory text for icons (i.e, ‚Äúsearch‚Äù as a label for a magnifying glass icon)
* Concise information around intended use of element
* Allow tooltips to be triggered by keyboard navigation
* Use arrows to indicate which element the tooltip is related too
* Use tooltips consistently (i.e. icon buttons have them, all tooltips are styled the same)
* Use ARIA tags when building tooltips to ensure they are accessible

<b>Dont's</b>

* Do not house information critical to user‚Äôs task completion
* Do not duplicate information such as calls to action labels creating information pollution
* **Do not use interactive components within a tooltip**
* **Do not make the user dismiss the tooltip**

| **Info (aka default)** | Provides contextual supportive information to the user                   |
| **info-alt**           | Not sure on what this is                                                 |
| **Error**              | Acts as inline validation                                                |

## Accessibility

* Use ARIA tags when building tooltips to ensure they are accessible
    * aria-labelledby if the tooltip works as a primary label (i.e. to name an IconButton action)
    * aria-describedby if the tooltip works as a supporting label (i.e. to give additional information on an input)
* Tooltips must be visible when their trigger is tabbed to/focused on via keyboard navigation
