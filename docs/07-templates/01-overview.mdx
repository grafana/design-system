# Grafana Template Components

Grafana design system templates are a set of pre-constructed patterns and code frameworks intended to provide developers and designers with a robust starting point for building user interfaces within the Grafana ecosystem. These templates are higher-level abstractions than the individual components in the design system, offering a more streamlined and efficient approach to UI development.
