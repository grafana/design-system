# Elevation <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>

Elevation within Grafana Labs provides clarity to the users about what information is where and sets boundaries where content can be placed and interacted with.


# Levels

Grafana has [4?] levels of elevation (conceptually considered different than z-indexes although we do use z-index for popovers) throughout the product suite. Each level of elevation has different rules around what type of content can be placed on it and how.

From highest to lowest:



1. Popoverl layer(s)
2. Secondary container
3. Primary container
4. Background canvas


## Definitions

### **Background canvas**
The page background is the lowest level of Grafana UI. Every other bit of UI is built up from the background level. Content cannot be placed directly on this level, it requires a Primary container at the minimum.

### **Primary container**
The primary container gets placed directly ontop of the background canvas. A primary container is required to house any and all content, as content cannot be placed on the background canvas.This is true even for pages like Dashboards, Explore and Panel Edit.

### **Secondary container**
Secondary containers sit on the primary container. When two levels of information are needed, the secondary container provides the option to set content one level up.

### **Popover layer(s)**

Cardinal layers are the prominent, most important (at the time) level of content in the UI. These layers are above all of the other levels.


## Popover layer

The content on the cardinal layer(s) can be layered up to 4 times and contain the following types of UI



* **z1** — tooltips/toggletips
* **z2** — dropdowns, menus, selects
* **z3** — pickers, drawers
* **z4** — modals
