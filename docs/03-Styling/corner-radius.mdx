# Corner Radius <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>

Rounded corners are mostly a stylistic choice to make the Grafana UI appear more modern, feel more friendly, and add extra sense of "polish" to the visual elements.

The measurement of rounded corners is corner radius, and it can be defined in pixels or percentages.

### Default Corner Radius (2px)
This is the general corner radius used for most UI elements, e.g. Buttons, Popover Panels, Tooltips, Widgets, Dialogs, etc.

### Full Corner Radius (100%)
Elements with 100% corner radius occur less often in Grafana's UI. Smaller UI elements, such as switches, get a full 100% corner radius for a smooth, clean edge around their rounded elements.
