# Design Principles <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>


Design principles empower designers and developers across the organization to make design decisions in the same manner regardless of the decision makers. Rooting product and design decisions in these consistent manners will help with consistency by having the same perspective to various problems.


## Task-at-Hand

Using a user’s primary task or focus as an anchor for decision making allows us to ensure they are able to complete various tasks easily and efficiently while not getting distracted or overwhelmed with unwanted or unnecessary UI clutter or user-flows. Keeping this in mind will help ensure our solutions are helping our users and not hindering them.

**Our UI should help users complete their tasks, not hinder them.**


## Tasteful Friction

Depending on the severity and priority of actions and workflows the appropriate level of friction varies greatly. Consider the action of saving. In its simplest form, a user could be saving the name of team; low risk, no real side-effects, easily corrected or adjusted. In it’s most complex form, a save action could be completely overwriting a dashboard or panel for a large number of users with ripple effects — other dashboards, reports, alerts — all could be impacted by this action. One requires very little, honestly no friction at all to ensure the user is aware of their actions. The other, the user needs to be very explicit on what they are doing and fully aware of the consequences of the action. 

**UI friction should be directly proportionate to the severity and risk of the user’s action.**


## Simple Solutions for Users

A simple solution does not mean it is absent of it’s own complexities. Typically, UI negotiates and compromises who gets the heavier load of complexities between the user and the system. A simple solution for a user might mean more work for us as UXers/Designers/Developers but it will result in a more simplistic experience and UI for the user. 

**A simple solution does not mean an easy solution — the system takes on the complexity of the action**


## Default to Reusability

Similar patterns across the product match to provide an expected experience for the user while navigating across the product-suite. Reusing components and patterns as much as possible helps to reduce our UI divergence, creating consistent interactions and experiences, lowering the chances of creating frustrating or surprising situations for users.

**Consistent UI and patterns creates expected interactions and behaviours resulting in better experiences**
