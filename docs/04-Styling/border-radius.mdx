# Border Radius <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge>

Rounded corners are mostly a stylistic choice to make the Grafana UI appear more modern, feel more friendly, and add extra sense of "polish" to the visual elements.

The measurement of rounded corners is border radius, and it can be defined in pixels or percentages.

### Default Border Radius (2px)

This is the general border radius used for most UI elements, e.g. Buttons, Popover Panels, Tooltips, Widgets, Dialogs, etc.

### Full Border Radius (100%)

Elements with 100% border radius occur less often in Grafana's UI. Smaller UI elements, such as switches, get a full 100% border radius for a smooth, clean edge around their rounded elements.
