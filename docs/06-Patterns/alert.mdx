## Types

Within Grafana, we have three different types of alerts and they can be used depending on the context and content.

| Type                                                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Behavior                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| **[Toast](/design-system/Components/alert-toast)**   | <p>These temporary window elements are used to display short messages; they appear at the top-right corner of the screen and can be dismissed by clicking the [x] or it will disappear after a few seconds</p> | <p>Passive</p>                 |
| **[Banner](/design-system/Components/alert-banner)** | <p>It will remain until the user rejects it or until the status that triggered the banner is resolved</p>                                                                                                      | <p> Persistent </p>            |
