# IconButton <Badge text='ready' color='green'></Badge> <StorybookLink path='/story/buttons-iconbutton--basic'/>

`IconButton`s are actionable buttons that only display an icon. Since there is no standard label, it's critical to include a tooltip with all IconButtons so the label can be accessed upon hover.

```tsx live
<IconButton tooltip="Add new" name="plus" />
```

### Do’s

- Always include the button's label in a tooltip.
- In exceptional cases where the tooltip does not make sense and the icon is unambiguous (e.g., <Icon name="angle-down" /> for expanding a folder), add an aria-label and the tooltip will be removed.
- When using an `IconButton` together with text, ensure they are aligned by adding a wrapper with `display: flex` and `align-items: center`.
- Use in areas that are limited in space and are in a low-context environment.
- Make sure the icon's significance is clear and unambiguous.
- Use `IconButton` instead of a `Button` when only an icon is needed.

### Don’ts

- Avoid using it in high-context situations.

## Types and behaviors

### Variants

| Type            | Style | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary**     | Ghost | Used for primary-based actions. Only use one per section. If there is no primary action, all Button components should be secondary.               |
| **Secondary**   | Ghost | This is the default-styling for buttons. It's used most frequently within Grafana and can trigger a variety of actions.                           |
| **Destructive** | Ghost | This is used for delete actions.                                                                                                                  |
| **Disabled**    | Ghost | Use this if the functionality the IconButton provides is not currently available, but the IconButton needs to indicate that this function exists. |

### Anatomy

- Icon
- Container (on hover)

### Placement

`IconButton`s are best used in areas that are limited in space and are action-heavy. These could be toolbars or in areas that provide inline editing such as tables or cards.

### Button Sizes

| Icon size | Name & size in Figma | Name & size in code |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 12px      | **small:** 20px      | **xs:** 20px        |
| 14px      |                      | **sm:** 22px        |
| 16px      | **medium:** 28px     | **md:** 24px        |
| 18px      |                      | **lg:** 26px        |
| 24px      | **large:** 48px      | **xl:** 32px        |
| 24px      |                      | **xxl:** 32px       |
| 24px      |                      | **xxxl:** 32px      |

### Accessibility

- Add a text for tooltip (it will also be used as the aria-label)
- In exceptional cases where the tooltip does not make sense add the aria-label.

## Behaviours

### Hover

On hover, the `IconButton` displays a tooltip that includes the IconButton’s label.
