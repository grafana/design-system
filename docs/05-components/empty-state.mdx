# EmptyState <Badge text='draft' color='orange'></Badge> <a href='https://developers.grafana.com/ui/latest/index.html?path=/story/general-emptystate--basic' target='_blank' className='header-links'>Storybook <Icon name="external-link-alt"/> </a>

The EmptyState component consists of a message and optionally an image, button, and additional information.

## When to use

Use an empty state to communicate to the user that there is no data to display and provide instructions for what to do next.
Example use cases:
- When a user has not created any particular resource yet
- When a filter or search query returns no results
- When a user completes all actions, such as clearing their inbox or notifications

There are different variants to handle the most common empty state use cases. These variants provide a specific default message and image.

## Usage

### `variant="call-to-action"`

Use when there is no data to display, and you want to encourage the user to take an action. Either to complete some initial configuration, or to create an item.

```tsx
import { EmptyState, LinkButton, TextLink } from '@grafana/ui';

<EmptyState
  variant="call-to-action"
  message="You haven't created any playlists yet"
  button={
    <LinkButton icon="plus" href="playlists/new" size="lg">
      Create playlist
    </LinkButton>
  }
>
  You can use playlists to cycle dashboards on TVs without user control.{' '}
  <TextLink external href="<externalDocsLink>">
    Learn more.
  </TextLink>
</EmptyState>;
```

For scenarios where there is no single button that can be clicked to create the item, you can omit the `button` prop. Instead, provide additional information to help the user understand how to create the specific resource.

```tsx
import { EmptyState, TextLink } from '@grafana/ui';

<EmptyState variant="call-to-action" message="You haven't created any library panels yet">
  Create a library panel from any existing dashboard panel through the panel context menu.{' '}
  <TextLink external href="<externalDocsLink>">
    Learn more.
  </TextLink>
</EmptyState>;
```

### `variant="not-found"`

Use in place of content when a search query or filter returns no results.

There are sensible defaults for the image and message, so in most cases you can use it without any additional props.

```tsx
import { EmptyState } from '@grafana/ui';

<EmptyState variant="not-found" />
```

### Advanced usage

For all variants you can:

- override the message
- override or hide the image
- provide a button (e.g. to provide a call to action or clear the search query)
- provide additional information via React children

```tsx
import { Button, EmptyState, TextLink } from '@grafana/ui';

<EmptyState
  button={<Button variant="secondary" onClick={clearSearchQuery} />}
  image={<AnyReactNode />}
  message="No playlists found"
  variant="not-found"
>
  Optionally provide some additional information here. Maybe even a link to{' '}
  <TextLink href="<externalDocsLink>" external>
    documentation.
  </TextLink>
</EmptyState>
```
