# Tooltip <Badge text='ready' color='green'></Badge> <StorybookLink path='/story/overlays-tooltip--basic' />

Tooltips display additional information upon hover or focus. The information included should be contextual, helpful, and non-critical to the user’s task-at-hand. The information should be concise and provide clarity to the user.

```tsx live
<Tooltip content="This is a tooltip">
  <Button>Hover me for Tooltip</Button>
</Tooltip>
```

## Usage

### Do's

- Provide supportive, explanatory text for icons (i.e. "search" as a label for a magnifying glass icon).
- Offer concise information about the intended use of an element.
- Allow tooltips to be triggered by keyboard navigation.
- Use arrows to indicate which element the tooltip relates to.
- Use tooltips consistently (i.e., all icon buttons have them, all tooltips are styled the same).
- Use ARIA tags when building tooltips to ensure they are accessible.

### Don'ts

- Do not house information critical to a user’s task completion in the tooltip.
- Do not duplicate information such as labels for calls to action, as this creates information pollution.
- Do not use interactive components within a tooltip.
- Do not force the user to dismiss the tooltip.

## Variants

| Variants               | Purpose                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Info (aka default)** | Provides contextual supportive information to the user |
| **info-alt**           | Not sure on what this is                               |
| **Error**              | Acts as inline validation                              |

## Accessibility

- Use ARIA tags when building tooltips to ensure they are accessible:
- Use `aria-labelledby` if the tooltip acts as a primary label (i.e., to name an IconButton action).
- Use `aria-describedby` if the tooltip acts as a supporting label (i.e., to provide additional information on an input).
- Tooltips must be visible when their trigger is tabbed to or focused on via keyboard navigation.

## Formatting

## Content

### Main Elements

**Trigger** - The UI control users interact with to display tooltips - standard **info-circle icon**

**Tip** - The triangle piece that points to the trigger element.

**Body** - The container that houses the content of the tooltip.

## Behaviors

### Triggers

- Icons (commonly information icon)
- Buttons
- Links

### User Interactions

Tooltips are triggered when the mouse hovers over or focuses on the UI trigger. The tooltip persists as long as the mouse remains over the active container or the UI trigger, or there is focus on the active container or UI trigger. The tooltip is dismissed by hovering away or moving focus to another element.
