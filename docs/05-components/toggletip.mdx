Toggletips, similar to [Tooltips](/components/tooltip), provide contextual support for users when needed. They are hidden by default, a UI trigger or text link is clicked to set them to their visible state. Toggletips, unlike tooltips, are persistent until a user takes action to dismiss them by clicking on the required `X` (close) trigger.

```tsx live
<Toggletip
  title={'Title of the Toggletip'}
  content={'This is the content of the Toggletip'}
  footer={'Footer of the Toggletip'}
>
  <Button>Click to show Toggletip with header and footer!</Button>
</Toggletip>
```

## When to use

Toggletips reveal **supplemental content** when a user clicks a button or another UI element and remains actively open until a user dismisses it.

### Do's

- Use when further context is needed to understand a topic.
- Link to supporting documentation or content via a link.
- Use when an interactive element must be placed within a tooltip-like component.
- Use content that needs to persist for users to reference until they dismiss it.
- Use for content that is informational to what a user is actively working on.
- Provide users ways to navigate to docs for further learning.

### Don'ts

- Do not use if a user would be configuring, selecting, entering data, or editing content on a page through the toggletip.
- Do not use when a [Tooltip](/components/tooltip) with clarifying text would suffice.
- Do not house information critical to a user’s task completion.
- Do not hide required information from a user to complete a task or workflow.
- Do not use to surface actions to users.

## Accessibility

Toggletips are revealed by clicking rather than by hovering and focusing. It's important for them to prompt screen readers to announce the information after the click event.

- Include [ARIA live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions).
- Use **type="button"** to avoid mistaking the trigger as a submit button.
- Use a describable label or aria-label on the UI-Trigger to ensure the user understands what extra information is in the Toggletip content (i.e. “More information”).

## Content

Toggletips may contain a variety of information, from descriptive text to interactive elements such as buttons or links.

## Behaviors

### Triggers

- Toggletips display on:
  - **User click** of UI trigger.
  - Pressing **ENTER** or **SPACE** on a keyboard while the trigger element has focus.
- Toggletips dismiss by:
  - **User click** of the close icon (x) — optional.
  - Clicking outside the popover container.
  - Pressing the **ESC** key.

### User Interactions

- Toggletips are intended to house interactive elements within them. UI elements such as buttons, text links, dropdowns, etc. are able to be fully interacted with inside of the toggletip.

### Scrolling

- In the instance that a toggletip requires scrolling of content (e.g. with a dropdown) the header and the footer of the toggletip remain fixed with the body enabling scroll.

### States

Toggletips have two states.

- Hidden — the default state of a toggletip.
- Visible — state change is triggered by ui-trigger click or keyboard enter.
