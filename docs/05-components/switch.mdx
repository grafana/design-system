# Switch <Badge text='ready' color='green'></Badge> <StorybookLink path='/story/forms-switch--controlled' />

The `Switch` component is used to toggle between two states, typically representing an on/off or enabled/disabled state.

## When to Use

Use the `Switch` component when you need to provide users with the ability to toggle between two states, such as enabling or disabling a feature, setting preferences, or making binary choices.

Switches trigger changes immediately. If your component should trigger a change only after sending a form, it's better to use either `RadioButtonGroup` or `Checkbox` instead.

Furthermore, switches cannot be grouped â€“ each `Switch` triggers an independent state update. If you want multiple mutually exclusive choices, the `RadioButtonGroup` is the better option. To offer multiple choices within the same group or context which are not mutually exclusive, use `Checkbox` instead.

## Implementation / Options

### Props

The `Switch` component accepts the following props:

- `value` (boolean, optional): Sets the initial value of the switch. When true, the switch is in the "on" state; when false, it is in the "off" state.
- `transparent` (boolean, optional): Makes the switch's background and border transparent for inline use.
- `invalid` (boolean, optional): Shows an invalid state around the input, typically for indicating errors.

### Example Usage

### Switch

```jsx live
<Switch invalid={false} label="Toggle feature" disabled={false} />
```

### InlineSwitch

```jsx live
<InlineSwitch />
```
