# TextLink <Badge text='ready' color='green'></Badge> <StorybookLink path='/docs/general-textlink--docs' />

The TextLink component renders an anchor tag `<a>` that takes users to another page, external or internal to Grafana.

```tsx live
<TextLink href="https://google.com" external>
  Go to Google
</TextLink>
```

## Usage

### When to use

- To redirect the user to another page, external or internal.
- When redirecting the user through a link in a word or phrase within a paragraph.
- When redirecting the user through a link in a word or phrase, not within a paragraph but surrounded by other blocks of text.

### When not to use

- When its purpose is to trigger an action, please use a Button or IconButton component.
- When it still redirects the user, but it should have the same appearance as a button, please use the LinkButton component.
- When the link is solely comprised of an icon, use the IconButton component.

### Do’s

- Use the default styles as the first and main option as they are designed to be accessible and consistent.
- Use the external icon (the default one) when the TextLink directs to an external page as its meaning is broadly known.
- In the instance the default icon does not fit, please use one of the icons from our [library](https://developers.grafana.com/ui/latest/index.html?path=/story/docs-overview-icon--icons-overview).

### Don’ts

- Do not use the ‘primary’ color in a standalone link unless it is a special use case such as the ‘Dashboard list’, menu items or similar.
- Do not override any styles in any way. Instead, [ask the Design System team](https://internal-ops-us-east-0.grafana.net/design-system/contributing/) for an improvement of this component.
- Do not attempt to add a new icon. You should follow a contribution path to first add the icon to our Design System and then use it in this component.

## Content

- The _TextLink_ component mainly contains text and, optionally, an icon.
- Make link text abundantly clear as to what the subsequent page is about.
- Avoid using phrases such as _Click here_, _More_, and _Read more_ unless they are within a card component or similar. Do not use them as standalone link text, as they can be confusing when a screen reader reads them out of context.
- Aim for a maximum of two links per paragraph.
- Keep link text short and concise.
- Never start with articles: _a_, _an_, or _the_.
- Avoid linking whole sentences; aim for a maximum of four to five words.

## Types

Within Grafana, there are two different types of _text links_: inline or standalone. They can either be wrapped by text or serve as a standalone element.

| Types          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inline**     | It is part of a broader text. It will be surrounded by text, before, after or in both directions. Although it can show an icon at its end, we advise not to do that |
| **Standalone** | It is a block not surrounded immediately by more text                                                                                                               |

### Subtypes

Both inline and standalone _text links_ will redirect the user to a specific page. Therefore, depending on their function, they can be either internal or external.

| Subtypes     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internal** | Redirect the user to a page inside Grafana                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **External** | Redirect the user to a page outside Grafana. The page will open a new window as we use `target="_blank"` and `rel="noreferrer"` to ensure that it is a safe [cross-origin destination](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/external-anchors-use-rel-noopener/) link. By default, an external _text link_ will show the `external-link-alt` icon |

## Formatting

### Anatomy

- Text: The link's text informs the user where they will be directed.
- Icon: The icon provides context about the destination. For example, by default, an external link will display the ‘external-link-alt’ icon. If the link leads to another part of the same page, the icon might be ‘anchor’.

## Placement

- Inline: (default) The inline text link will follow the alignment of the text wrapped around it.
- Standalone: This type of text link requires a parent element / container in which to set the appropriate display value.

## Behaviour

The following is the default behaviour and will be applied according to its type.

1. Inline:

   Default: Blue and underlined. The user will be able to change this value through the color prop, but the rest will remain the same.

   On hover: Blue and not underlined.

2. Standalone:

   Default: Blue and not underlined.

   On hover: Blue and underlined.

## Spacing

- Between text and icon: the gap is set to 0.5em, so it will adapt itself to the change of the font size
- The text itself: there is no margin or padding applied
- Between the block text and the text link the space is not modified, so will be the same as the existing between the words of the paragraph.

## Accessibility

- The text that contains the link should be informative
- The aria-describedby attribute can be used to provide extra text for a screen reader besides the link text.
- Assistive technology may consider an ARIA label to replace the link text, so if there is a need for more context please use aria-describedby.
