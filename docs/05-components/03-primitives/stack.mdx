_Available from v10.2.3_

## Overview

The Stack component is a simple wrapper around the flexbox layout model that allows to easily create responsive and flexible layouts. It provides a simple and intuitive way to align and distribute items within a container either horizontally or vertically.

### When to Use

- For creating responsive and flexible layouts that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
- When needing a simple and intuitive way to align and distribute items within a container either horizontally or vertically.
- To easily reorder and rearrange elements without changing the HTML structure.
- When aiming to create equal-height columns.
- To create a grid-like structure with automatic wrapping and sizing of items based on the available space.

### When not to Use

- For complex multi-dimensional layouts with intricate requirements that are better suited for CSS frameworks or grid systems.
- When precise control over spacing and positioning of elements is necessary.

## Props

### Display

There are 5 different props related to how the content is displayed:

- `direction`, with possible values: `row`, `row-reverse`, `column`, `column-reverse`
- `wrap`, with possible values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, `wrap-reverse`
- `alignItems`, with possible values: `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `baseline`, `start`, `end`, `self-start`, `self-end`
- `justifyContent`, with possible values: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, `start`, `end`, `left`, `right`
- `gap`, with possible values: ThemeSpacingTokens (0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 10)

If you just need to create a Flex layout without any other styling to the box, please use the **[Stack](/components/primitives/stack)** component instead.

```tsx live
<Stack direction='row' wrap='wrap' alignItems='center' justifyContent='center' gap={5}>
  <span>One</span>
  <span>Two</span>
  <span>Three</span>
</Stack>
```

### Responsiveness

All of the above props can be defined in a responsive way, meaning that different values will be set depending on the window size.

To define any of them responsively, simply pass in an object with responsive breakpoints as keys. For instance, instead of defining direction in this way `direction='row'`
define it like  `direction={{ xs: 'column', md: 'row' }}`.
This means that from the `xs` breakpoint up, direction is set to `column`, while from the `md` breakpoint up, it is set to `row`.

The possible breakpoints in the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/packages/grafana-data/src/themes/breakpoints.ts#L28).
