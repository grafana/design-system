## Overview

The Grid component is a layout component that allows you to create a grid of columns and rows to organize content and elements. It is a wrapper around the [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) specification.

### When to Use

Use the Grid component when you want to create structured and organized layouts where content or elements need to be aligned in rows and columns for clarity and consistency.

### When not to Use

Use the **[Stack](/components/primitives/stack)** component instead for these use cases:

- **Alignment:** More options for item alignment.
- **Flex items:** Custom flex basis or configure how items stretch and wrap
.
## Props

There are two ways to define the `Grid`, either by number of columns or by the minimum column width.

_Note: There is no support for using `columns` and `minColumnWidth` props at the same time. The correct behaviour is working just with one of them not both._

### Columns

The `columns` prop defines the number of columns that the grid will have. The columns will be equally sized.
The props that you can use are:

- `columns`, with possible values: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12
- `gap`, with possible values: ThemeSpacingTokens (0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 10)

```tsx live
<Grid columns={4} gap={2}>
  <span>1</span>
  <span>2</span>
  <span>3</span>
  <span>4</span>
  <span>5</span>
  <span>6</span>
  <span>7</span>
  <span>8</span>
</Grid>
```

### Minimum column width

The `minColumnWidth` prop defines a minimum width that each column can have, the number of columns will be determined by the available space.
The props that you can use are:

- `minColumnWidth`, with possible values: 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21 | 34 | 44 | 55 | 72 | 89 | 144, where the number will then be multiplied by the grid size.
- `gap`, with possible values: ThemeSpacingTokens (0 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 8 | 10)

```tsx live
<Grid minColumnWidth={13} gap={2}>
  <span>1</span>
  <span>2</span>
  <span>3</span>
  <span>4</span>
  <span>5</span>
  <span>6</span>
  <span>7</span>
  <span>8</span>
</Grid>
```
### Responsiveness

All of the above props can be defined in a responsive way, meaning that different values will be set depending on the window size.

To define any of them responsivelly, simply pass in an object with responsive breakpoints as keys. For instance, instead of defining direction in this way `columns={4}`
define it like  `columns={{ xs: 1, md: 4 }}`.
This means that from the `xs` breakpoint up, the column number is 1, while from the `md` breakpoint up, it is 4.

The possible breakpoints in the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/main/packages/grafana-data/src/themes/breakpoints.ts#L28).
