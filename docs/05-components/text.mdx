The Text component can be used to apply typography styles in a simple way, without the need for extra CSS.

## Usage

### When to use

- To display text with styles applied consistently across the product, and to provide structure to each page.

### When not to use

- If there is any direct interaction between the text and the user, a more suitable component should be used such as Button, TextLink, Menu, etc.

### Do's

- Headings should be organized hierarchically.
- When a heading needs to have the appearance of another heading rank but it will affect the page heading hierarchy, use the `variant` prop to modify its style instead.
- Use weight or italics for emphasis.

### Don’ts

- Do not use the `element` prop simply for its appearance, use it to organize the structure of the page.
- Do not use color for emphasis as colors are linked to states such as `error`, `success`, `disabled`, etc.
- Do not use the `code` variant for anything other than code snippets.
- Avoid using `p` as the `element` prop if the Text has nested components as it may break the DOM nesting rules.

## Content

The content of the text should be written according to the [Grafana writing style guide](https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/write/style-guide/).

## Formatting

The following is the default behavior and as such, it will be applied according to its type.

### Anatomy

The Text component mainly comprises itself. On occasion, the Text component can have another Text or TextLink component as a child.

```jsx live
<Text color="primary">

  <TextLink href="https://grafana.com/docs/writers-toolkit/" external>
    Writer’s Toolkit
  </TextLink>
  .
</Text>
```

### Behaviour

The Text component can be truncated. However, the default rendered element for the Text component (when no value is set in the element prop) is `<span>`. This is an inline container that must have a parent, which may or may not be another Text component. Therefore, truncation must be applied to the parent element.

1. If the parent element is a Text component: the user simply needs to set the element prop to a different value and set the truncate prop to true. As a result, the Text will be truncated, but the full text will be visible in a tooltip when a user hovers over it.

```jsx live
<Text color="primary" element="p" truncate>
  And Forrest Gump said: <Text italic>Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.</Text>
</Text>
```

2. If the parent element is not a Text component: the user needs to add `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `whiteSpace: 'nowrap'` to it. In this scenario, the user should wrap this container with a Tooltip so that when the text is truncated, its content can still be viewed by hovering over the text.

```jsx live
<Tooltip content="This is an example of a span element truncated by its parent container">
  <div style={{ overflow: 'hidden', textOverflow: 'ellipsis', whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>
    <Text color="primary" variant="body">
      {'This is an example of a span element truncated by its parent container.'}
    </Text>
  </div>
</Tooltip>
```

## Accessibility

- There should be only one `h1` heading per page.
- Headings should be organized according to their significance: `h1` has the _rank 1_ while `h6` heading has the _rank 6_. For instance, `h1` can be used for the page heading, `h2` for the titles of sections, and `h3` for subsections.
- The ranking of headings should be continuous. An `h2` should not be immediately followed by an `h5`, but an `h2` can follow an `h5` if this is closing the previous section. Skipping heading ranks should be avoided as much as possible because it can be confusing.
